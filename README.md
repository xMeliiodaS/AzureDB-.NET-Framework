# AzureDB-.NET-framework
This project is crafted using the C# language, harnessing its expressive power and versatility to create a robust and efficient solution.

Simplify your interactions with Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB using CosmosDB Helper. This Python library offers an intuitive set of tools for creating Cosmos clients, managing entities in the cloud, refreshing database and table lists, and more. Streamline your Cosmos DB workflows with ease.

Connect to the emulator:<br>
-Choose the connection source – either the emulator running locally or an Azure Cosmos DB account.<br><br>
-Specify the necessary credentials like the name of the Cosmos DB account, endpoint URI, and primary key for authorization.<br><br>
-View the client status – whether they're currently connected to the emulator or the Azure account.<br><br>

-Create a database and table in the cloud: The user can enter a name for the database and table, and then click the "Create Entity in Cloud" button.<br><br>
-View a list of databases and tables: The user can see a list of all the databases and tables that have been created in the cloud. They can also refresh the list or delete a database or table.<br><br>
-Check if a database or table exists: The user can enter the name of a database or table and then click the "Check if Exists" button. This will tell them whether or not the database or table exists in the cloud.<br><br>
-View the client status: The user can see whether or not the client is connected to the cloud.<br><br>

-Search for databases containing tables with the user's name.<br><br>
-Get a list of databases containing at least a specific table.<br><br>
Specify an "X" table (the purpose of this isn't clear from the image).<br><br>
-Get databases based on the specified "X" table.<br><br>
-View the client status (likely whether it's connected to a database).<br><br>

Choose to upload files to the cloud or not:<br>

-The user can enable or disable cloud file upload by clicking the checkbox next to "Cloud Keys and Client Creation".<br><br>
-Enabling this would likely allow uploading form data or files collected through the form to a cloud storage service.<br><br><br>

Database and table selection:<br>

-The user can see a list of databases and tables potentially related to the form.<br><br>
-It's unclear from the image what these databases and tables are used for in the context of the form.<br><br>

Activity log:<br>

-The user can access an activity log, potentially to see past actions or changes made to the form.
